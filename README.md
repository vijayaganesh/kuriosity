# Project 'KURI'OSITY

### An Attempt to build an Intelligent and Autonomous Home Robot from scratch using opensource technologies.
### Inspired from Kuri by Mayfield Robotics.

You'll be missed Kuri! The cutest robot ever!

## What is Kuriosity?

Kuriosity is an attempt to learn by building an autonomous mobile wheeled robot using state of the art, yet open source technologies and off the shelf components while costing under $700.

## Why Kuriosity?

* Ever since I heard about Kuri during my summer internship at Fetch Robotics (They build the Best robots in the world. PERIOD), I wanted to buy one when they become available. But unfortunately, Mayfield [ceased](https://www.heykuri.com/blog/important_difficult_announcement/) the production of Kuri. 

* Being a Robotics enthusiast / Grad student, I had the oppurtunity to work on existing robot platforms (Eg: Clearpath Husky, Turtlebots) and also simulate robots in Gazebo. However, I had the desire to build one by myself to understand the nuances of intricate systems which I usually took for granted (Read publishing joint_states/tf, hardware interfacing, sensor fusion etc).

* Kuriosity will be a test bed to try out different technologies. I'd also use kuriosity for my course work projects.

* Kuriosity will extensively use opensource components, and contribute to them if I manage to fix an issue or come up with an enhancement.

* And of course, Bragging Rights :sunglasses:!!!
